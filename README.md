## Hi there 👋

I'm Munal Baraili, a data engineering student based in Australia.

I build projects that give me *aha!* moments — usually when something breaks, scales poorly, or behaves differently than expected.

I constantly explore ideas (often at random moments), prototype them, and turn the best ones into structured projects. Some are finished, many are experiments — all are learning-driven.

I work mainly with:
**Python, SQL, Spark, AWS, Docker**, and applied **machine learning**.

I’m especially interested in:
- data pipelines & system design
- performance trade-offs
- turning messy data into reliable systems

Most of my polished work is public, while ongoing experiments live in private repos.

If you’re into data engineering, system thinking, or building things that *actually run*, feel free to connect.

### Fun facts
- I deep-dive into new topics using a personal “2-week mastery” rule
- I learn fast by studying people who’ve already solved the problem
- I recently started rock climbing
- I enjoy design, sketching, and visual thinking
